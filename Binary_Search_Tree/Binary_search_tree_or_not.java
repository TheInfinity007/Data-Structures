/*
Given binary tree is binary search tree or not 

A binary tree is called binary search tree if it holds following three properties: -
a. The left subtree of a node contains nodes whose keys are less than that node’s key.
b. The right subtree of a node contains nodes whose keys are greater than that node’s key.
c. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Your task is that given a binary tree check if it is binary search tree or not. Complete the function isBinarySearchTree() which takes the address of the root node of tree as parameter and return 1 if the tree is binary search tree and 0 otherwise.
